Solve the puzzle by drawing the icon. The numbers in the headers describe the number of consecutive cells in that row or column.

This puzzle was inspired by one of those brain training exercises that pop-up every now an then, and like most puzzles of that sort I find myself wonder how to "game" the system by working out the underlying logic. This one was simple enough for me to actually have a go and I created bulk of in an afternoon. I have been tinkering with it on and off since. 

The icons initially came from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free)from which I'm only using a subset that are particularly ... iconic. You don't want the image to be too busy or it won't work in a smaller grid. I have since updated the pool of images to include emojis, for which [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) is my go-to resource to searching, copy and pasting, and find out interesting trivia such trending patterns of [âœ¨](https://blog.emojipedia.org/its-not-just-you-the-sparkles-emoji-is-everywhere/).

More interesting to me than the puzzle itself is that the project has served as a springboard to look at additional technologies and frameworks I wouldn't otherwise have been exposed to during my working life.
