This puzzle was inspired by one of those brain training excerises that pop-up every now an then, and like most puzzles of that sort I find myself wonder how to "game" the system by working out the underlying logic. This one was simple enough for me to actually have a go and I created bulk of in an afternoon. I have been tinkering with it on and off since. 

More interesting to me than the puzzle itself is that the project has served as a springboard to look at additional technologies and frameworks I wouldn't otherwise be exposed to during my working life.
